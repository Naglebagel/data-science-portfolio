## 1. [Identifying and Addressing Transit Deserts in the Bronx](./Transit-Deserts-Bronx)
- **Skills:** Python, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, statsmodels, scikit-learn  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Socioeconomic EDA of NYC census tracts  
  - Welchâ€™s t-tests and logistic regression (McFaddenâ€™s RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.541)  
  - KMeans clustering with choropleth maps  
- **Impact:** Identified transit inequities and provided policy insights for underserved Bronx communities.

## 2. [Musical Instrument Image Classification (CNN)](./Instrument-CNN)
- **Skills:** Python, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Designed and trained 3 CNN models (`instrument_net01`, `instrument_net02`, `instrument_net02_tuned`)  
  - Achieved >90% accuracy with dropout tuning and model refinement  
  - Visualized accuracy/loss curves to evaluate performance  
- **Impact:** Built scalable deep learning models for image-based instrument classification.

## 3. [NBA Player Performance Prediction (Random Forest)](./NBA-Player-Prediction)
- **Skills:** Python, Pandas, Plotly, scikit-learn  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Cleaned and standardized 40+ performance metrics across 700+ players  
  - Conducted interactive EDA with Plotly (correlation heatmaps, scatterplots)  
  - Applied Random Forest regression to predict player performance  
- **Impact:** Uncovered which player stats most strongly influence predicted outcomes.

## 4. [UEFA Champions League Player Recommendation System](./UCL-Recommendation-System)
- **Skills:** Python, Pandas, Plotly, scikit-learn, ipywidgets  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Integrated multi-table dataset of Champions League players  
  - Built performance indices and applied KMeans clustering  
  - Developed an interactive recommendation dashboard  
- **Impact:** Simulated a scouting tool categorizing players into Buy, Sell, or Evaluate Further.
